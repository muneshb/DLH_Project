# Project to reproduce Paper id 32: Deep Patient Similarity Learning for Personalized Healthcare

CS598 Deep Learning for Healthcare Project

## Project Motivation

This paper aims at calculating a very important metric in Healthcare domain which is the Patient Similarity. Patient similarity is the concept of re- searching the most and least effective treatments based on the health records of like individuals with comparable health conditions. Adopting a patient similarity approach can enhance decision-making process in clinical practice, since there is a lot of clinical learning which measures the relative simi- larities between pairs of patients EHR data.
